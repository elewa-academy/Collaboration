# Approaching Challenges

It's time to put your group to the test!

The goal of collaborative challenge solving is gather a variety of experts and create new and hybrid lenses for understanding your challenge. Then to invent solution methods that grow from this new understanding.

To do this, you can't jump right into creating your solution.  The first thing you'll have to do is carefully define the challenge you're trying to address taking into account the diverse perspectives and experiences in your group.

This may feel like a waste of time when you already know how to solve the challenge, but remember that isn't the point of collaborative challenge solving!  You're not managing a team to implement your solution, you're working with other experts to find novel ways of solving your challenge.

You can't find a truly novel solution without a truly novel perspective.
