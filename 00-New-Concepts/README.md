# Understanding New Concepts

Being able to learn and unlearn new concepts is the fundamental skill required for effective collaboration.  

You are already very effective at solving problems in your own field with your own methods.  But the point of collaboration isn't to get more people implementing your methods. The goal of collaborative problem solving is gather a variety of experts and create new and hybrid lenses for understanding your problem. Then to invent solution methods that grow from this new understanding.

In order to contribute in this context you must be able to flexibly understand and adopt your collaborators' view-points.

## Being Wrong

The largest impediment to effective learning is an inability to admit you could be wrong.  

The traditional view on being wrong is that __you__ are wrong.  If something you believe or know is wrong, that must mean that you are at fault.  This is far from the case.  Continuing to believe will lead to ineffective collaboration.  

What follows is three ideas that will help you be gracefully wrong:

### Ideas vs. Identity

The ideas you have are not you.  Separating your pride and identity from the ideas you propose will enable smooth collaboration.  

You and the group can focus on navigating the problem and solutions spaces.

### Contextual Truth

Right and Wrong are contextual.  Your suggestions may be correct in your field of expertise, or in a previous project, but that does not mean they are right in every context.

Different contexts come with a different set of relevant facts, and facts define truth.  

You must be aware of shifting contexts when assessing your ideas.

### Perspective-based Truth

There are more than one ways to interpret the same set of facts.  Depending on your background and motives you will interpret the same facts into a different truth.

When working with a group you must be aware that it's possible for two seemingly contradictory propositions to be true.  

This is the strength of collaboration.  By accepting that there are multiple ways to view the same situation, you can begin to explore the apparent contradictions.  Exploring these liminal zones is what drives true innovation.

## Asking Good Questions

Often, in formulating a clear question you will find your answer.
Analyzing your list of questions, you can see:
Am I on topic?
Am I distracted in breadth or depth?
What seem to be recurring confusions? 
Can I trace those to a common source?
Automatically building up a study plan for the next days.
If you do a good job organizing your questions.

good study questions come in many forms:
	not open ended 
	predictive and falsifiable


What do I plan on doing with an answer to this question?

diversify your questions:
	100 chemists vs 10 + 90

metaquestions:
	why did i privilige x question?
	Does this question have a definitive answer? Will I know I have the right answer when I find it?
	Is this question in a reference class with other questions that led to important or significant answers?

good questions will come with bounds on answers:
	ie. i'm asking about how variables work, if i come accross the word 'hoising' i'll back off for now

levels of questions
	knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation
