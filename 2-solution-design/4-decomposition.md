## solution design

begin proposing solutions.  your solution needs to respect the consensus-understanding of the problem and the agreed-upon constraints.

strategies:
* decomposition
* "borrowing"
* third-party solutions
* ... 

split into sub-solutions that leverage individual strengths

=======

Problem decomposition is central to challenge solving.  Being able to look at a large challenge and understand it as many small challenges strung together will make you a better human.  

Some of many advantages:      
* You have created helpful constraints.  Two smaller challenges are easier to approach and will usually result in a higher quality finished product.  
* Collaboration becomes easier. You can split work with the guarentee that each person's contribution will be valuable.  
* It can guide the analysis phase.  Often the hardest question is how to start understanding a challenge. by first decomposing a new challenge, you can skip being confused by how to start.  Decomposing is always worth your time.  
* Smaller pieces are easier to code.  Decomposing large challenges brings them closer to code, making the trasition to a practical solution much simpler.  
* Apps built of smaller apps are almost always easier to test and maintain.  
  
I'm sure there are more benefits to breaking down large challenges, but these should be enough to convince you.  

Getting good at this will just take practice.
