# Creating Solutions

you've analyzed and you've constrained.  You now have a novel and shared understanding of the problem

---

## solution design

begin proposing solutions.  your solution needs to respect the consensus-understanding of the problem and the agreed-upon constraints.

strategies:
* decomposition
* "borrowing"
* third-party solutions
* ... 

split into sub-solutions that leverage individual strengths

will move content here soon

___

## implementation

decompose the now-defined solution

determine a dependency tree for these sub-problems
state diagrams: https://www.smartdraw.com/state-diagram/

reassemble them into a roll-out schedule

for each roll-out step
* define & assign tasks according to group member strengths
* have a plan for fitting them back together
* decide on kpi's
