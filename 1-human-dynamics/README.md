# Human Dynamics

This section explores the human factors of effective collaboration.  

You will learn how to: 
1. Adopt different perspectives to understand the same challenge in new and innovative ways.
2. Engage in open and effective communication to share your perspectives and experience.
3. Apply these skills in your own work to support strong collaborations, either as a manager or a managed.

To introduce you to each learning objective there will be a group exercise and a page with additional explanation, resources, and practice for that topic.
