# Group Dynamics

primary indicator of success will be shared vision and motivation.  if that's not there fat chance.

After that it's a question of establishing group norms that will foster intelligent decisions, true innovation, and quality learning.

the rest of this looks at what's next

Creating strong group dynamics is not as hard as it might seem. By admitting you're wrong and engaging in empathy-based communication you're over half-way there!

To over-summarize everything that follows:

> Group success can be predicted by group communication.

This markdown will provide an overview of findings related to group dynamics.

## Group Norms

- foster psychological safety
	turn taking
	empathy
	- these things are important because they foster ps


https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html
	clear goals
	culture of dependency

your work will have impact
	foster this 

support risk taking
encourage being wrong / saying dumb things
hear each other out
care about how everyone is doing 
	not necessarily in a "let's party" way
	just in a "they're gumpy today"
respect strengths
bolster weaknesses
https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/help-teams-take-action/

maybe this means anonymous feedback?
	but this can get tricky when groups are small

you wont always have control over this as a team member.  but you can do your part to foster it, and recognize it to compensate in your own part
	frame as learning problem
	admit falability
	model curiosity

ps
	important only when theres uncertainty & interdependence
	ie. when your project isnt total lego bricks
		* goal: good collaboration to define & construct solution, then break into individual tasks?

## Group Intelligence

- deprecate into group norms?

research is conflicting on how group iq is correlated to individual iq
	but we all know there's something extra to a good team
	research looks at generalizations
	each group you work in is a specific
		get to know each other
		recognize strengths and weaknesses
		rely on each others strengths
		shoal up each others weaknesses

2 main traits
	equal participation
	tom, empathy scores (social intelligence)
		this isn't about being touchy feeling
		it's about recognizing how things are going
			when this person looks bored it's usually because they think they've a great idea you're not letting them speak
			this person is having a hard week, but generally has very good ideas. let's give them a little more time to speak before moving on
			this person has a grade a rbf and can be comabatitive.  they're from boston, it's nothing personal

individual intelligence vs collective intelligence (group effectiveness)
theory of mind
communication
empathy

## Group Roles

there are many methods for structuring groups, none are wrong and none are right.  it's contextual. 

we won't talk about any particular way of doing things, after all they all rely on the skills you're learning here.

but there will always be some sort of hierarchy, even if you say there isnt.  how do you deal with that?  

then we talk about korea and deference and that stuff

types of relationships
	managed
	managing
	same-role peer
	different-role peer

most important is that each person's role is clearly understood by everyone
	can change with each sprint
	can stay consistent
	can be anything, but it must be clear and consensual
	the role has impact
